# OrgoMolLLM
LLM that uses text-decription of organic molecules to predict properties and generate molecules

Currently most of the raw_data and csv file containing the training data sit in a onedrive. They are too big to be put on GitHub
one can use these scripts to generate that data and maybe in the future I will detail how that can be done

## Currently Working On:
writing a sanityCheck script
